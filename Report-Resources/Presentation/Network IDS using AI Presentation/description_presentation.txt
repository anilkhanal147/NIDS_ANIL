 Slide 1:

In this section, I would like to provide an overview of my project, which centers around enhancing cybersecurity through a web-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS).
My name is Anil Khanal, and my aim is to utilize machine learning for effective anomaly detection in network traffic with the help and guidance of my supervisor Mr. XXXXXX.

Iâ€™ve outlined specific objectives that include:

* Examining different methods for intrusion detection systems
* Preprocessing the necessary data for analysis
* Training robust machine learning models
* Enabling real-time analysis through a developed user interface that also supports CSV data uploads

The project methodology encompasses data preprocessing followed by the training of models such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Isolation Forest, which are ultimately integrated into a modular, web-based platform.

As we move to the results and the overarching conclusion of my project, it is notable that the Random Forest model yielded a remarkable F1-score of 1.00, representing a perfect accuracy level.

Moreover, our system demonstrated real-time packet sniffing with a latency of less than one second, indicating high efficiency in monitoring network traffic. The design of an interactive user interface further contributed to an enhanced user experience.

In conclusion, the project has successfully established a robust, modular web-based NIDS, achieving high accuracy alongside usability.

Looking forward, future work will focus on:

* Integrating more advanced deep learning models for improved performance
* Applying Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) methodologies
* Automating alerting mechanisms for rapid threat response
* Developing scalable architectures to support larger workload demands
* Continuously enhancing the UI for optimal user interaction
